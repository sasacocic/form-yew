# think about

- figure out a way to easily test this macro
- from the angel list takehome how would I handle being able to dynamically add a field to the this macro?
  Like if you have `Vec` or something? How would it be handled to handle the updating of that nested struct field?

- tailwindui componenets - how will this integrate with tailwindcss and the components there - basically thinking how this
  macro will work with other inputs

## exercises

1. think of some ui / forms that could exist then see what it would take to get that binding logic done in form-yew
